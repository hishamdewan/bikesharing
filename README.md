# Citibike Bikesharing Service in NYC
The purpose of this analysis is to create visualizations that can provide a potential investors insights needed to invest in bikesharing service in Des Moines, Iowa. Before the investment can be made, looking at New York City's Citibike service could provide insight that can be used as inputs for designing a new service.

# Resource
 - Data is sourced from Citibikes.[This site](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data/) has background information of the Citibikes data set. This [dataset](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/201908-citibike-tripdata.csv.zip) was used for the analysis.
 - Software: Python 3.7.10, Pandas, Jupyter Lab, Tableau Public 2021.3
 - The Tableau Story is hosted in [this](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hisham.dewan/viz/CitibikeNYC_16371920959930/NYCCitibikes?publish=yes) Tableau Public site.

## Summary:
The analysis shows bike sharing is a popular mode of transport with approximately 2.3mn rides in 2019. Bike sharing tends to be popular in tourist heavy areas and during busy commuting hours (i.e. 7-9am and 5-7pm). The analysis shows vast majority of trips are short (less than one hour) and subscription service leads to significant increase in ridership. In addition, the service is more frequently used by men than women. 

These conclusions are useful to understand the success of the bike sharing program in NYC but more research is needed to understand the viability of the program in Des Moines given the difference in population density, city design, climate, tourist, available modes of transport, etc.  

Two additional visualizations for future analysis include:

- Utilization levels of various bike sharing stations. Perhaps higher utilization stations are more profitable and require more resources. 
- Looking at profile and purpose of riders such as tourism, commute, etc.
